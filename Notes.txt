Configuration File:

-deck list
    -throw away none main deck parts
-maybe read a ydk file instead of in same file.
-declare scenarios
-state which to display at the end

Structure:

-store scenarios to do not repeat evaluation
-tree of nodes
    -operators and scenarios
-short circuit operator evaluation
-node per operator
-node per single match as leaf
-TODO: figure out duplicates and overlap of sub-scenarios.

Parser:

-Like a compiler going over expressions.
-Table driven?

Later Versions:

-add special ability to cards
    -example, when a hand includes a draw card, apply draw to look at more cards for evaluations
    -draw, example Pot of Greed
    -excavate, Pot of Duality
    -draw then discard, Graceful Charity
    -other such as Pot of Desires, Reasoning, Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon

-provide more options for writing configuration file?
    -allow some regex for stating cards?

-additional options for command line arguments?
    -maybe put in the planned (yet to be written) command line argument parser
