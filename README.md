Application to calculate the chance of drawing a hand from an arbitrary finite deck. Obviously without repeat. The calculation is performed through simulation (unfortuantlely due to the mathematics being a bit to complicated for the complicatated expresseions that a user may define).

Pull requests welcome.

TODO: expand when application done to include example of use.
