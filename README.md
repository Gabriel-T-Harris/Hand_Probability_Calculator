Application to calculate the chance of drawing a hand from an arbitrary finite deck. Obviously without repeat. The calculation is performed through simulation (unfortuantlely due to the mathematics being a bit to complicated for the complicatated expresseions that a user may define).

Pull requests welcome.

Examples of input and output can be found in Input and Output folders respectively. Those are just examples as one can pick both of those locations.

TODO: expand when application done to include example of use.
