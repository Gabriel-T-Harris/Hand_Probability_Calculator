Special Abilities:
-Dimensional expansion to both the hand being tested and the capabilities of the program.
-Evaluate at the level in which hands are drawn.
-Transform hand into new custom Locations object. Hashmap -> arraylist for locations. Some functions for handling internals too.
    -Change evaluation stuff accordingly.
    -Hashmap be scalable.
-Alter parsing stuff to account for new Special Ability section. Place section between decklist and scenarios.
    -Essentially all the parsing stuff. As new locations means new places to look.
-Ensure lack of optional section does not reduce performance compared to previous version.
-Implement some deterministic abilities.
    -Draw
    -send cards to a location
        -Mill
        -Banish
    -Examples: Pot of Greed, Reasoning, Pot of Desires, maybe Pot of Extravagance.
-Additionally have activation limitations, defaulting to infinite.

Custom Parallelisation Algorithm:
-Collapse parallelisation at Scenario level to reduce amount of object creation. Additionally object recreation is more expensive then reseting said objects.
-Potentially factor out into own library, then call said library.
-Replace magic numbers representing task backlog range with a slightly reduced calculated values.
    -Factor in number of processors.
    -Objective is also to reduce memory use by a bit. This will have multiplicative effect, given predicted increase memory use.

Other:
-Introduce breaking change of "deck list" to "decklist" in configuration files.
-Write out some example usages of Special Abilities.
-New operator like a combinator
    -Given set of A items choose B of them (none-repeat), in which B < A.
    -Would ease scenario writing without proving anything new in terms of computability.
    -Example: (A AND B) OR (A AND C) OR (B AND C), would be written as new operator choose 2 of {A, B, C}.
    -Figure out format.

Next Version:
-Expand Special Abilities to incorporate/handle ones which branch into multiple 'hands'.
    -For example, Pot of Duality, Pot of Prosperity, and Graceful Charity.
    -Not going to bother with something like Draco-Face Off, but is implementable in the same vein.
    -Excavate
    -Also will result in some grammar changes.
